# ProDev Backend Engineering Program

## Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is a hands-on, deep-dive into the tools, strategies, and architectural decisions required to build and scale modern backend systems. While I had prior experience with several tools and frameworks, this program helped me solidify my understanding of _why and when_ to use them. It emphasized designing backend systems from scratch, understanding system design and database design deeply, and adopting best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Technologies Covered

### 🐍 Python & Django

- Built projects using **Django**, an opinionated full-stack Python framework for rapid development.
- Utilized **Django REST Framework** (DRF) to create robust RESTful APIs.
- Implemented features using Django’s **ORM**, middleware, signals, and class-based views.

### 🔍 Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Used Python’s `unittest` to validate components in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensured components work cohesively when integrated.

### 🌐 APIs

- **REST APIs**: Designed clean and RESTful endpoints with authentication and permission layers.
- **GraphQL**: Explored its flexible query structure and plan to integrate it in future projects.

### 🐳 Docker & Kubernetes

- Dockerized applications for consistent, environment-independent deployments.
- Learned **Kubernetes** fundamentals:
  - Pods, Nodes, Clusters, and Deployments.
  - Implemented **rolling updates**, **blue-green deployment**, and **canary releases**.

### 🛠️ CI/CD

- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server used to build and deploy pipelines.
- **GitHub Actions**: Used workflow files (`.yml`) to automate tests and deployments on GitHub events.
- **Travis CI**: Set up builds to automatically test and deploy projects from GitHub repositories.

### ⚡ Caching

- Used **Redis** as an in-memory key-value store for caching and background tasks.
- Applied caching strategies to reduce load on APIs and databases.

### ⏰ Cron Jobs

- Implemented background tasks using **Celery** with **Redis** or **RabbitMQ** as brokers.
- Scheduled periodic jobs like cleanup tasks, reporting, and notification dispatches.

## Backend Development Concepts

### 🧱 Web Application Architecture

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Learned different tiers (1-tier to N-tier) and their real-world applications.
- **Monolithic vs Microservices**:
  - Monoliths are easier to start with, but harder to scale.
  - Microservices support scalability, modularity, and fault tolerance.
- **Serverless Architecture** (FAAS): Explored AWS Lambda, Firebase Functions, etc.
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Decentralized communication model used in Web3/blockchain systems.

### 🌐 Networking Basics

- **Protocols**:
  - HTTP/HTTPS: Standard web communication protocols.
  - TCP/IP: Core internet protocol stack.
  - WebSockets: Persistent connections for real-time apps.
- **Ports & IP**: Understood IP addressing and common port usage (e.g., 80, 443).
- **Firewalls**: Network security systems that filter incoming/outgoing traffic based on security rules.
- **SSL/TLS**: Encryption protocols that secure web traffic.
- **DNS**: Domain Name System resolves human-readable addresses to IPs.

### 🖥️ Web Infrastructure

- **Servers**:
  - **Web Servers**: Serve static content (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
  - **App Servers**: Handle dynamic content (e.g., Django, Node.js).
- **Load Balancers**:
  - Distribute requests using algorithms like round-robin, least connection, IP hash, etc.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Tools like **Datadog** or **Prometheus** to track server health and logs.
- **Firewalls**:
  - Configured firewall rules to restrict unwanted or malicious traffic.

### 🔐 Authentication & Permissions

- Implemented authentication using:
  - Token-based auth (JWT)
  - Session-based auth
  - OAuth (exploratory)
- Configured DRF permissions: `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, custom permission classes.
- Secured routes and protected sensitive operations.

### 🔒 Security

- Best practices implemented:
  - CSRF/XSS protection in Django
  - Input validation and output sanitization
  - Rate-limiting and throttling

### 📈 Analytics

- Tracked user behaviors using event logging.
- Logged requests and errors for observability.

### ⚙️ Asynchronous Programming

- Used **Celery** with Redis/RabbitMQ for background task queues.
- Understood async views and database interactions in Django (async/await).

### 🗃️ Database Design

- Designed and normalized relational schemas using PostgreSQL.
- Built and interpreted **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**.
- Practiced **data normalization** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to reduce redundancy.
- Used indexes and foreign keys for performance and data integrity.

## Python Concepts Mastered

### 🔁 Generators

- Used generators (`yield`) for memory-efficient iteration over large data sets.

### 🧩 Decorators

- Created custom decorators for logging, caching, permissions, and DRY logic.

### 🧼 Context Managers

- Used `with` statements to manage resources like files, DB sessions, and external connections.

## Personal Takeaways

- **Clarity Over Tools**: This program helped me transition from simply using tools to mastering their underlying principles, enabling me to make informed architectural and design decisions with confidence.
- **System Thinking**: From architecture to delivery pipelines, I now approach backend systems holistically.
- **Improved Confidence**: I can now confidently design systems from scratch and take ownership of entire backend components in a product team.
- **Adaptability**: I’ve developed the mindset to research, adapt and evolve with technology instead of just relying on frameworks.
